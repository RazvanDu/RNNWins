# Enhancing Transformer RNNs with Multiple Temporal Perspectives

## Abstract
This project introduces a novel approach to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures by incorporating multiple temporal perspectives. This method enriches the model's understanding of sequential data, significantly improving context interpretation. By integrating this technique into the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, we address its limitation of retaining all historical information within a single hidden state, with only a minimal increase in the number of parameters.

## Introduction
Transformer networks have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks. However, they face challenges with long sequences and computational efficiency. Our work leverages the RWKV architecture, combining Transformer's training advantages with RNN's inference efficiency, and introduces multiple temporal perspectives to enhance language processing capabilities.

## Proposed Approach
Our method maintains diverse temporal views of the text, enabling the model to learn complex patterns effectively without full pre-training. This approach involves fine-tuning additional parameters dedicated to multiple temporal perspectives, resulting in improved performance across multiple benchmarks.
